Any requests made from this session object to websites protected by Cloudflare anti-bot will be handled automatically. You can effectively treat SpankBang as if it is not protected with anything.

# Usage
1. Install Python 3
2. Clone this repository (download all files here)
3. Enter 'setup.py install' in the console
4. Take input.txt and sb_scraper.py to any directory you want and use it. The text file contains a list of video, playlist, channel or profile URLs.
5. Or, Insert a custom .txt file as an argument in the command prompt/terminal (like 'sb_scraper.py theseurls.txt') (or drag a .txt file over the script file) into split.py to split it up into 4. You can run multiple instances of Scraper at once. 

# Features
- Drag a txt file of choice onto the .py file to run that, otherwise, double clicking will default to input.txt
- Playlist URLs as input work to output a .txt file of URLs which can then be fed back into the program
- split.py splits any txt file with several lines into 4 files. Can be used for playlists.
- Does not work with VR videos.
